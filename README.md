MEOW MEOW MEOW CATS ARE AWESOME

**notifi-CAT-ions:**

- Window size should be small-ish, from 5-15. (LK assumes that the entire window moves in the same direction. adjust based on predicted motion of image. Pyramidal LK already does the job of larger windows)
- Console throws warnings as we sometimes do SVD on bad matrices. SVD needs the corner detector.
